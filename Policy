# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: September 26, 2025

Thank you for using our Video Converter application. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our app.

## Information We Collect
We do not collect, store, or share any personal information from users. All video conversions and related processes occur directly on your device. No files are uploaded to external servers.

## How We Use Information
Since we do not collect personal information, there is no usage of user data beyond the functionality of the app. The app only processes the files you select for conversion on your own device.

## Data Security
Because all processing occurs locally on your device, your files and personal information remain private and secure. We do not transmit, store, or share your data.

## Third-Party Services
Our app does not integrate with third-party services that collect user data.

## Children's Privacy
Our application does not knowingly collect or request personal information from children under the age of 13. Since we do not collect any data, the app is safe for all ages.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in this document with an updated effective date.
